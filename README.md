** Inspiration **

As someone living in Rwanda, I've seen firsthand how confusing and inconsistent Moto taxi pricing can be for tourists and non-Kinyarwanda-speaking people. Many visitors get overcharged or avoid motor altogether due to uncertainty. Although the Rwandan government has already made efforts to stop this by providing riders with fare phones, most motorcycles do not use them, as they are seen as a way to increase earnings. Although the Rwandan government has already made efforts to stop this by giving riders fare phones, most motorcycles do not use them to get more money.
What it does
RwaMoto is a web tool I made that helps users get accurate price estimates for motorcycle rides in Rwanda. It uses Google Maps to calculate trip distance and time, and applies local pricing standards to show fair fares. It also gives basic tips for first-time users.

** How we built it**

I built the frontend using HTML, CSS, and *JavaScript, and used **Google Maps Platform to handle map rendering, directions, and location data. Users input their pickup and drop-off points with access to Google Maps search autocomplete, and then the app calculates the estimated price based on a pricing algorithm informed by public pricing guidelines published by RURA(Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency) and data gathered from me and locals.


Challenges we ran into

This was my first full project, and I had almost no personal guidance, just YouTube, documentation, trial and error, and Claude chats. The basics of organizing files, setting up a domain, and publishing the site were confusing at first.
This was also my first time using an API, and learning how to make requests, understand responses, and secure my Google Maps API key was a huge learning curve. I had to teach myself how to integrate Google Maps for routing and distance calculation, and then apply that data to a good pricing formula.
I also had to go out of my comfort zone to make a satisfying design. I had never used Figma before, and designing a user-friendly interface was a whole new skill set. Being someone I would personally say is not the artistic type, making something nice to look at was tough, but I knew if I wanted to make something that would get used even to the slightest degree, it was important.
Accomplishments that I am proud of

Learn, I feel one of the biggest accomplishments with the project is just how much I learnt from going through technical and design challenges completely self-taught
Helped solve a local problem that I think will have a big impact with my skills *Used Google Maps effectively to provide value to both travelers and the local transport system
Built a fully functional mapping and pricing tool for real-world use


What I learned


How to use an API for the first time and handle data securely *How to integrate Google Maps APIs into a real-world web app
How to design a frontend using an industry-level tool like Figma
The importance of user experience when solving a problem
How persistence and self-learning can go a long way, even without personal guidance.


What's next for RwaMoto


Have a randomly selected group of individuals I can find to test and get feedback on the website's design and pricing
Try to partner with a local Moto driver association or the Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority(RURA)
Due to being tailored to tourists, adding multilingual support would be beneficial.
Improve the website design and responsiveness by learning to implement frameworks
